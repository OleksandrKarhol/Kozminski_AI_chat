About the major







The HoReCa Management major is designed to introduce and prepare students for active participation in the HoReCa sector (Hotels, Restaurants, Catering). The program will show the latest and best management practices from around the world, supported by a large dose of information provided by practitioners from the sector.

If you are interested in running your own restaurant or want to support your family in this area, we will help you to acquire key skills in this field. If you are planning a career in a company that supplies the sector, you will learn how to operate it and what to look out for in cooperation with hotels, restaurants, and catering.
The classes are co-organized with practitioners, updating academic knowledge with practical know-how. We will expand your management knowledge with sommelier skills or supply chain optimization.
You will learn what problems hotels, restaurants, and catering are facing and learn how to deal with them. We will give you the necessary tools for effective management. You will also be able to develop this knowledge after graduation from one of our programs, including postgraduate studies in hotel or restaurant management.
See you at Kozminski University!
