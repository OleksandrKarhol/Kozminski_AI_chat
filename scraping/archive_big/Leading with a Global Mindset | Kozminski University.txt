We created this special learning experience to help post-MBA leaders to further expand their leadership competencies. Using experiential learning methodologies, delivered by expert Faculty in a purpose designed facility, participants explore, practice and design their own responses to global challenges.Our aim was to create an environment in which we close the gap between knowing how to be a leader and being a leader.

- dr Sylwia Hałas-Dej , Kozminski Executive Business School Dean
DO YOU ASPIRE TO BE A GLOBALLY MINDED LEADER?
Are you ’damn’ curious about what is going on – on the micro, macro and meta levels?
Are you ready to test and challenge your current beliefs and assumptions?
Do you have the courage to face complexity and turn this to opportunities and actions?
Do you really love people with all the diversity and chaos they bring to your teams and projects?
Do you understand your key stakeholders and how to navigate shared and conflicting goals?
Do you know how to engage with different generations of employees and clients?
Do you have mental toughness to handle fear of the unknown and stay resilient?
Do you know how to let go of the past and lead from what emerges in the moment?
	 
These are just a few examples of questions the globally minded Leader should ask himself.  We will challenge and guide you to answer “Yes” to these questions with confidence!
 










THE COURSE PARTNER IS EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING HUB










"At Experiential Learning Hub we believe Leadership is an ART and SCIENCE. You will bring YOUR ART to it. ELH will provide SCIENCE i.e. inspiration and methodologies to help you make progress in your leadership work. We will achieve it by inviting you to different "Leadership Workshops" „Laboratories" „Action Learning Groups", in which will test and enhance your skills. 
In this self-directed and experiential learning environment you will get support of executive coaches,  inspiring faculty members and a group of other international leaders. "




























WELCOME























                                                                            Dorota Szkodny-Ciołek
                                                                    
While teaching a class on Leadership at the ALK ExeMBA for about 15 years and working individually with a large number of leaders, I learned a few things. One of them is that each leader is unique. You will never be able to duplicate any leader you may be admiring, and you will never learn how to lead by reading leadership manuals. Your leadership development will always stem from your personality, personal resourcefulness, unique experiences, dreams, and aspirations. Any leadership style you will develop will need to be refined over time. You will definitely need to modify how you think about leadership and how to upgrade your skill set. That’s a given in the practice of exercising leadership.
Our Program serves that purpose - it helps you elevate your leadership to another level by offering space, know-how and tools. Ultimately, it provides you with what’s most important - trainers and coaches whose passion is to work with leaders to lead them to success, help them sustain themselves over time, and most of all to make the world a better place.

THE COURSE FRAMEWORK














The science of Leadership lies in the mastery of a wide range of important competencies.
Our framework identifies key competencies in three distinctive areas of responsibility that are essential for leaders to divide their time and energy:
Creating the future
Creating Environment for success
Managing the Present and the Past  
We encourage you to consider:
How much time you spend weekly in each of these 3 areas of leadership responsibility?
What level of mastery do you have today for each of the competencies illustrated here?














WHO IS OUR PROGRAMME FOR?












This Programme is for Polish and international leaders who have a minimum of 3 years of experience in managing people and teams.   
Because our Labs are designed to be experiential and reflective, they require participants to be highly curious and open to learn. Participants should be ready to step out of their comfort zone to explore new ways of thinking and acting, to look critically at existing practices and experiment with new approaches.
We have a selection process to ensure that each person will add value to the learning experience for the cohort as a whole.  This process includes a 1-1 conversation with one of our coaches to confirm your motivation, needs and expectations















COURSE PROGRAM

Where classes are held?










Villa Poranek is dedicated to helping leaders and their teams to succeed in our rapidly changing world. Everything at Villa Poranek has been designed to provide the best environment to enjoy quality time together - to talk, reflect and learn and develop new ideas and strategies
Villa Poranek, dating back to 1910, was one of the first residences built in Konstancin. Its first owner Wilhelm Rubin was the founder and first president of the Polish Association of Medical Doctors. In the post-war years, the building was neglected to the extent it became uninhabitable. The Villa is located in the natural beauty of the park surrounded by pine trees, the river, cycle paths and many outdoor facilities.

Mentor and Performance Coach 
 My purpose is to shorten the time needed to become a top performer for people I work with, either in sport or in their business or simply focused on professional career.
6 World Champion’s titles and over 20 years of professional athlete career have given me experience and know-how what qualities, skills and approach to sport and life in general are necessary to be successful. Today, as a mentor, I pass this knowledge to other athletes and entrepreneurs. I share my experience and strategies also via Akademia Mistrzów Świata, which I co-founded this year.
This educational platform aimed at athletes participating in any level of competition. Akademia is the place where you can find ready-made technics and solutions to sports problems successfully tested by top athletes, World Champions, Olympic medallists. As part of Akademia, subscribers also receive access to knowledge and advice of experts in the field of psychology, physiotherapy, nutrition, technology, media and sponsorship.

Business Advisor and Mentor, former Regional CEO PwC CEE
Having spent 30+ years in consulting and senior international leadership roles at PwC, I love helping my individual and business clients to grow and transform their businesses, manage stakeholders and become more resourceful leaders. 
Throughout my career, whether in the UK, Poland, CEE or as part of the global leadership team, I could see how important it was for people at the top of organisations to bond and mobilise people around them. Without this ability to connect, even the smartest strategy or the most needed business change could not be implemented.

Being a leadership coach is who I am and what I love to do most. With over 20 years of experience running experiential EMBA programs, leadership workshops and having conducted hundreds of coaching hours, I came to believe that teaching and learning leadership can only be done through experiential learning and courageous (self)reflection. Such processes strengthen character as well as improve leadership competencies more rapidly .
Think about leadership as an ‘instrument’ that you can use to increase the capacity to adapt quickly to the changing world and to making dreams come true. In each leadership endeavour there is a combination of art, science and a bit of magic that when put together, increase personal and organisational capacity, making the world a better place. ELH’s ambition means to be a part of that growth and magic.

Co-founder of Villa Poranek, Strategy Consultant, Facilitator and Mentor.
My professional purpose is to help ambitious leaders to transform their organisations and unlock the potential of their people.  After 20 years as a business leader in telecommunications and IT, I started my second career after moving to Poland from the UK. 
I love to help leaders to step back from the chaos of daily operations and lead their organisations with clarity of purpose, a compelling vision and adaptive strategies to be successful.  Most of my work involves building ‘human centric' leadership to influence key stakeholders and mobilise people to make an impact.   Today, I feel proud of the achievements of our global alumni of leaders who continue to thrive with confidence, courage and resilience.

Executive Coach.
My experience from work in the humanitarian sector showed me that making our world a better place requires much more than just a beautiful heart, passion, or even technical expertise. Above all, it requires leadership that is authentic, empathetic and responsible for every action. I truly believe that responsible leadership and openness to diversity are essential to create a healthy environment for life.
I have 13 years of experience working in the non-governmental sector. I have been a leader of teams that have delivered humanitarian aid in the most remote areas around the globe. 
Currently, as a certified coach, I work mainly with humanitarian aid workers worldwide. My greatest passion is to support leaders from impact organisations and businesses to help them grow and discover the essence of humanity as they develop their leadership.

Being a leadership coach is who I am and what I love to do most. With over 20 years of experience running experiential EMBA programs, leadership workshops and having conducted hundreds of coaching hours, I came to believe that teaching and learning leadership can only be done through experiential learning and courageous (self)reflection. Such processes strengthen character as well as improve leadership competencies more rapidly .
Think about leadership as an ‘instrument’ that you can use to increase the capacity to adapt quickly to the changing world and to making dreams come true. In each leadership endeavour there is a combination of art, science and a bit of magic that when put together, increase personal and organisational capacity, making the world a better place. ELH’s ambition means to be a part of that growth and magic.

Co-founder of Villa Poranek, Strategy Consultant, Facilitator and Mentor.
My professional purpose is to help ambitious leaders to transform their organisations and unlock the potential of their people.  After 20 years as a business leader in telecommunications and IT, I started my second career after moving to Poland from the UK. 
I love to help leaders to step back from the chaos of daily operations and lead their organisations with clarity of purpose, a compelling vision and adaptive strategies to be successful.  Most of my work involves building ‘human centric' leadership to influence key stakeholders and mobilise people to make an impact.   Today, I feel proud of the achievements of our global alumni of leaders who continue to thrive with confidence, courage and resilience.
