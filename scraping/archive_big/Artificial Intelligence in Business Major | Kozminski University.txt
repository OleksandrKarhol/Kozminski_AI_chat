About the major








The main goal of Artificial Intelligence in Business Major is to provide students with up-to-date knowledge, skills and social competences required for successful implementation of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques to solving real business problems.
 
During the program, the students will advance their programming and data-scientific competences as well as learn to apply deep learning and natural language processing to business cases and organizational strategies. Moreover, participants will have at their disposal various workshops related to Algorithmic Bias, and AI Ethics and Governance as well as new and emerging business models. This major is an opportunity to take a deep dive into the next wave of digital transformation of organizations that embraces AI, data management, edge computing and IoT, but does not shy away from societal problems.
 
It is a perfect choice for those who merge technological skills with advanced management competences. The program aims to educate the next generation of tech entrepreneurs, ready to solve global problems by putting AI to good use.
 
Students who have not acquired skills in Python and machine learning during their undergraduate studies and are interested in choosing the Artificial Intelligence in Business major should complete the following two courses, offered as electives, during their first year of graduate study:
 

Basic Python and Machine Learning (semester I)
Advanced Python and Machine Learning (semester II)
Please be advised that the major will launch only if a minimum amount of 17 students sign up for the major.

Innovation can never be taken for granted. We believe that leaders need to better understand AI and data-driven technologies to be active stakeholders in the ongoing technological revolution. Our aim is to equip students of this program with the right skills to benefit from the change, but also direct the change. After all, we use tools only to solve problems, so we designed the program to develop this problem-solving capacity.

We have created this program because we believe that general purpose technologies, such as AI, will transform our lives and our professional world. We also believe that the more of us feel confident in using AI the better it is for everyone. Fair, transparent and accessible AI for wide business applications is a mission we embark on.
