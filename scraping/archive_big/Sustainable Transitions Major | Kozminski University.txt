About the Major







Graduation from the Sustainable Transitions major on the Master in Management program will allow alumni to gain up-to-date and comprehensive knowledge of business opportunities and challenges resulting from the process of radical transformation (e.g. EU climate neutrality and European Green Deal goals, Fit for 55, US Green New Deal, UN Sustainable Development Goals, Paris Agreement, Decade of Ecosystem Restoration).

The ambition is no longer just to reduce a company's negative impact on the environment by 10%, for example in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, but to reduce it tenfold. The next goal is to create positive effects for the environment, for example producing products with negative emissions when more CO2 is absorbed than produced over the life cycle.

Sustainable transformations aim to fundamentally rebuild the economy and social life in response to the climate and environmental crisis.

Graduates will gain an in-depth knowledge of the trends shaping sustainable transformations in key sectors of the economy and the skills to apply this knowledge to plan, design, and implement innovative changes in specific areas of business.

Graduates will gain advanced skills in combining knowledge from different disciplines and building cross-sectoral agreements to actively engage in the global transformation process. The involvement of practitioners from companies and organizations most advanced in sustainable transformation efforts in the preparation and teaching of the course provides current and practical knowledge of how to implement sustainable practices in business.
The program is addressed to graduates of undergraduate programs in Poland and abroad who want to actively work in sustainable business transformation and are looking for a place that will equip them with the necessary knowledge, skills, and contacts to do so.
