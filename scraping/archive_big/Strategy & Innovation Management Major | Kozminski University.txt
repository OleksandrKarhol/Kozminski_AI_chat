The capacity to think strategically is a fundamental quality of the global manager in the 21st century. In courses I teach (Strategic Management for Growth, Business Model Innovation) I seek to instill in students critical thinking about the firm and its environment, how to structure the business problem, how to ask non-obvious questions in the process and find out-of-the box solutions. These are universal skills that will be of value in any business context.
