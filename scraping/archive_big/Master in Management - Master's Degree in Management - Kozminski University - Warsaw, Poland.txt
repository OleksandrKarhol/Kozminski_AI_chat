"I am glad that I chose the Master in Management program at Kozminski University. After having worked at an IT company in Minsk and then later in Moscow for a while, I was considering receiving a proper business education abroad. Kozminski and the Master in Management program are highly ranked by Financial Times and some of my friends (now successful businessmen) studied here. So, there was no doubt of applying to Kozminski. The Master in Management program a good mixture of theoretical knowledge and provides practical skills in the fields of Business Strategy and Management, Accounting and Economics, Management Psychology and many more.
All the cases we discuss during the seminars are real up-to-date business cases of Polish companies and big international brands, which allows me to see what is going on under the hood in real companies. Apart from receiving a useful theoretical base, Kozminski teaches me soft skills such as adaptability, flexibility, stress management, and many other skills which will be applicable in my further career – whether it is the corporate world or my own startup. Though it might sound nerdy,I do enjoy my studies for the value of the knowledge the students receive here is immense."Read more
