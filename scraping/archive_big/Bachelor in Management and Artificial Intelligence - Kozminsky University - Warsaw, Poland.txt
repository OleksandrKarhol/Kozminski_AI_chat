About the studies









Basic information










The Bachelor in Management & Artificial Intelligence is a 3-year undergraduate program conducted fully in English.
The program is a rare, but very necessary combination of insightful management knowledge with programming skills and data analytics.
The studies are aimed at educating more and more managers demanded on the labor market, who simultaneously have:
business skills
knowledge of new technologies, in particular AI, and their impact on society
knowledge of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed research methods
programming competencies (programming in several languages, strong emphasis on Python and  R)
knowledge of machine learning techniques used in business
The studies are run only in full-time mode.
In November 2022 the first technological student club at Kozminski University was established. Kozminski AI Club is run by a group of young enthusiasts fascinated by the world of rapidly developing technology.

Our goal is to provide a space for curious students to develop their technical skills through real-life projects, educational materials, and exchanges with like-minded individuals. In addition to learning and growing as a community, we also aim to give back to the tech industry by hosting networking events, guest lectures, and providing tech support for founders with amazing ideas for startups.
